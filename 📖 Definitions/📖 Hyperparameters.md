# Hyperparameters

**Definition**: Hyperparameters are the external settings you configure before training the model. These parameters are not learned from the data but are chosen manually or through hyperparameter tuning techniques. For example, the **number of trees** in a **random forest** or the **learning rate** in a **neural network**.
