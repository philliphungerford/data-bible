- # Data Warehouse
- By contrast (to a [[ðŸ“– Data Lake]]), a data warehouse is relational in nature. The structure or schema is modeled or predefined by business and product requirements that are curated, conformed, and optimized for SQL query operations. While a data lake holds data of all structure types, including raw and unprocessed data, a data warehouse stores data that has been treated and transformed with a specific purpose in mind, which can then be used to source analytic or operational reporting. This makes data warehouses ideal for producing more standardized forms of BI analysis, or for serving a business use case that has already been defined.
