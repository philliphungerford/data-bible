- # false positive rate
- $$
- \text{False Positive Rate (FPR)} = \frac{\text{False Positives}}{\text{False Positives} + \text{True Negatives}}
- $$
- Proportion of actual negatives incorrectly identified as positives.
- - **Usefulness**: The **False Positive Rate (FPR)** is often considered when you are interested in controlling how often negative cases are falsely classified as positive. **Low FPR** is crucial in applications where the cost of a false positive is high.
- - **Context**:
- - **Security systems** (false alarms in intrusion detection or fire alarms)
- - **Fraud detection** (false accusations of fraud could hurt innocent individuals or businesses)
- - **Key Focus**: Minimizing the occurrence of false positives, which can lead to unnecessary actions or costs.
