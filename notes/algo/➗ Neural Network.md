- # Neural Network
- When building a neural network. Make sure you understand the problem you are trying to solve.
- binary = binary_crossentropy
- multiclass = categorical_crossentropy
- ## Model Building Process
- 1. Make sure you have as much data as you can have
- 2. Try to have the best features
- 3. Start with 1 hidden layer with number of neurons the same size as features
- 4. Add more layers or neurons until the model begins to overfit.
- 5. Overfit the model
- 1. adjust the learning rate
- 6. Try to generalise after overfitting
- 1. weight regularisation
- 2. dropout
- Monitor all of this by examining the [Learning Curves/Rates](ðŸ“–%20Learning%20CurvesRates.md)
