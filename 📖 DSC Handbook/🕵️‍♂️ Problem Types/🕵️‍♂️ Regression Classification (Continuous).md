**Definition**: Predicts a continuous numerical value based on input features.

**Examples**:
- What will the house price be based on its features? (e.g., size, location, etc.)
- What will the temperature be tomorrow based on historical data?
- How much revenue will the company generate next quarter based on previous performance?

**Common Algorithms**: 
 [[➗ Linear Regression]]
 [[➗ Decision Tree]]
 [[➗ Random Forest]]
 [[➗ XGBoost]]
 [[➗ Neural Network]] (e.g., Deep Learning Models)
 [[➗ Support Vector Regression (SVR)]]

**Evaluation Metrics**: 
 [[✅ Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)]]
 [[✅ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)]]
 [[✅ Mean Squared Error (MSE)]]
 [[✅ R-squared (R²)]]
 [[✅ adjusted R-squared]]
 [[✅ Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)]]
