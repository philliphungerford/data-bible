# false negative rate

$$
\text{False Negative Rate (FNR)} = \frac{\text{False Negatives}}{\text{False Negatives} + \text{True Positives}}

$$

Proportion of actual positives incorrectly identified as negatives.

- **Usefulness**: The **False Negative Rate (FNR)** is important when you want to minimize the **missed positive cases**. Itâ€™s the complement of **Sensitivity**, so it is relevant when you want to ensure that all potential positives are detected.

- **Context**:

    - **Medical tests** (e.g., missing a diagnosis like cancer)

    - **Security and surveillance** (not detecting a threat or breach)

    - **Customer churn prediction** (missing a customer who is likely to leave)

- **Key Focus**: Minimizing false negatives, preventing missed positive cases.
