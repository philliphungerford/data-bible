- 11AM - Unprocessed notifications kick off
	- use - surgery data for outcomes 
	  epath - histology, receptive status etc for pathways
	  timeliness is important 
	  what notifications are useful;
	  epath surgery radio chemo 
	  monthly refresh?? esp for lung
	  July 1st is lung 
	  epath lung needs to come from pipeline and not NSWCR
	  1PM - patient table meeting
	  Nadine has table of all items together
	  what are next steps ...

	- Found a model called facebook/bart-large-mnli which is a zero shot NLP model. It is useful when giving it a sentence and it can categorise it without training...
	  The facebook/bart-large-mnli model is a version of Facebook AI's BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model fine-tuned on the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI) dataset. This fine-tuning enables the model to perform tasks like zero-shot text classification by evaluating whether a given text (premise) entails, contradicts, or is neutral to a hypothesis statement.Key Features:- Zero-Shot Classification: The model can classify text into categories it wasn't explicitly trained on by framing the classification task as a natural language inference problem. For example, to determine if a text is about "politics," the model assesses the likelihood that the text entails the hypothesis "This text is about politics."- Versatility: Beyond zero-shot classification, the model is suitable for tasks like textual entailment and general text classification.- Integration with Hugging Face Transformers: The model is readily available through the Hugging Face Transformers library, allowing for easy implementation in various applications. 
	  Will try and compare a zero shot model with the Abrevio API.
