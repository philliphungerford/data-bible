Created jupyter notebook script for Grants pipeline, just need to finalise filtering for the approved variables looks like 90% of the V1 conversion is done will also need to migrate it to a proper format which I will also check with [[jamie-gabriel]]. Looks like there may be a V2 that has been made that has a few additional variables. Need to check this with [[jamie-gabriel]].
