Finding ways to compile C in R (testing in Rworkbench)

SHINY DASHBOARD (QUALITY DASHBOARD) -> [[71410 - Metadata Quality Dashboard V1.0]] –> PURPOSE: heres all the data, stuff about it, data quality explorer, variables –> Audience: researchers –> Data quality dashboard across all datasets –> basic statistics of each (mean, sd etc) –> pull from all into one db (dbplyer??) –> react table, sparklines, –> Standardising variables (standards eg. HSL, Meteor (AHW), each variable has categories (persons, treatments, diagnosis) –> Graph network of all variables across all datasets –> Potential errors: —-> formatting of variables (e.g. DOB should always be date in this format)
DATA LAKE –> Amazon S3 blob level –> Drag in blogs –> Radio direct drag radio data into lake –> connects directly to source for some LHDs –> R schedule within Amazon to run over blob code –> Data Analytics Platform (DAP): Amazon -> Sagemaker via NSWHealth –> host code on githealth –> notebooks within the env can be scheduled –> monitoring access etc –> ML anomaly detection for apps
MLD –> pbs mbs lives in SURE –> other version without lives in S drive –> linked data assets, MLD, CANDLE, –> make is accessible –> possible ML models on MLD –> knowing the data well enough to know what it is capable/incapable of –> Richards team works a lot with MLD data –> how CINSW can model the health data (e.g. bayes). –> Talk to Lisa about MLD
LAPTOP –> Get admin access –> New laptop –> Docker
