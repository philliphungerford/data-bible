Check importing / managing very large tables in PowerBI, preprocessing? Permutation calculations?
2023-05-16 
Today you managed to tidy the TCRC data enough to begin analysis
Created code for 5 questions
Got access to AWP and created a notebook instance that works
2023-05-01 
Finish PCCR content table
2023-04-28 
Complete urgent MLD items
2023-04-27 
Going through PCCR stuff.
2023-04-26 
Began going through PCCR content table wrote down notes in ticket

Shubhankar met up to discuss the encryption API, he needs to encrypt items larger than 8 characters and is asking how to do so.
2023-03-22 
Create the variable explorer page for the 3 datasets we have
2023-03-21 
Spoke to Shubankar, Kathryn, Anna, Tracey CEO, Hui, Veronica
Did code review for PCCR
Need to tidy TCRC stuff
Completed the Data Asset explorer page for the 3 datasets we have
2023-04-04 
currently cleaning TCRC datasets
Rename column names
check and tidy each column

Got access to the data lake
1000- data lake
Suraj presentation
User guide
supported types are XML, JSON, CSV under 5GB per file
Mapping of file share SMB
Will see the Folders we have access to (project folders>datasets)
Keep a ‘golden file’ as a reference as it dissapears in the file share
Add timestamp
Same filename will not overwrite data if ran at 1015 vs 1020
Understand the formats for the meta data table.
naming - products vs data, vs types
capture dependencies outside of the app <- flow chart?
1130 - Jamie
we may spin up our own scheduling service
pull metrics out of the data lake -> grabs its own meta data
Clinical Trials App (DJANGO) is different to Clinical Trials Base data that Kathryn and Zara are working on
Data quality statements
base vs analytics
QUARTO for grants automated report
Create docker environment for shiny apps

Jamie
Multi cloud account
meta data dashboard
script will pull from meta data table
find the database name
use that to gather metrics
things need to be in the same format? -> intermediary script to build this (steal from MLD pipeline)
patient table -> converage on patient level
facility table -> coverage on facility level
2023-03-10 
Create prototype dashboard for meta data dashboard
Sprint standup
PCCR content table
because we are sourcing from a different version of the base data we need to create a script to pull the PCCR content variables from the ADT
Spoke with veronica to see if any of the ~160 variables would be in the analytics extract (with 200ish variables).
Hui OROD -> finding many duplicates (if name, start and end dates are the same but one variable might have missing or a different value)
Wally
PRMS MLD updated
Have in the template to update the meta datatable when pushing
compare meta data tables to columns in the tables
Preprod and prod names
ACTIONS
Wally to do the meta data column compare with meta data assets script
Determine versioning
Maria
Issues register updated
Semantic versioning
2023-03-09 
A - Finalise MLD
Create pull request
Run final test on all rows
turn test = off and run (may take an hour or so)
create link procedure
either condition in the main function or separate file
loads the content table
inner joins ppns
splits into respective tables
saves
finalise PCCR variables
meet with veronica
what variables are approved in the ATD?
what variables are in the analytics extract?
what variables are NOT in both
check filters are all valid
Cross reference atd and identifier spec
check variables within the ATD
convert pdf table to excel table
add column for “in MLD”
30min each = 3hrs maybe
B - Grants - gather and define requirements
go through spec sheet
find out what the first revision of the dashboard wnats to look like
how to get there
C - Meta data dashboard
send mockup to jamie
generate front end
generate backend
mock up ideal dashboard on paper / one note

Josh was ging to do UAT on prms 2.0 - had no idea what he was doing. Data dictionary on the webstore is old (source is actually pre-prod). Jamie manually updates the meta-data table. Veronica has been manually updating the data elements tables. Put this as part of the pipeline and wrote code to update the data asset metadata table. UAT server the D&E table is up to date.

Extract is working! Just need to:
Check all variables are included (a few hours)
Radio
Chemo
Uncoded
Get variables from PCCR analytics code to generate PCCR content file
Check filters are correct
Radio
Chemo
PCCR
Uncoded
Update ‘Link’ scripts for phase 2
Generate a the specification files for each
Radio
Chemo
Uncoded
PCCR
Make sure all variables are loaded
Approved Variables List file contains all of the variables for each of the MLD data sets:
Radiotherapy -> NSW Outpatient Radiation Oncology Data (NSW OROD)
Chemotherapy -> NSW Outpatient Systemic Therapies Oncology Data (NSW OSTOD)
PCCR -> NSW Prostate Clinical Cancer Registry (NSW PCCR)
Un-coded -> Subset of NSW Cancer Registry Data (NSW CRD) with Uncoded notifications

Uncoded is done, just
Encryption done needs endorsement
Sheena
Josh & Peter for 6m each, Peter for the first 6 months,
PCCR UAT passed
PRMS UAT passed
make pull request PCCR base to Main

1100 - EROD
Enhanced Radiation Oncology Dataset
Celebrating 10 years
Began with an SQL within Excel to extract data
Course can have multiple treatment plans
Not as gradular as OMIS
Fields are not included
Row level is drug
Can include extra information (compassionate drugs)
Does not cover in-patient settings
OMIS - No indicators, other linkages
EROD - has indicators coming off it, for some time,
Treatment extract -> EROD -> Patient -> Diagnosis -> Course -> Treatment plan -> fractions
If moved to in-patient it is not collected in MOSAIC
Level of care plan
