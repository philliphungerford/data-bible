Morning
TEA - API complete on validation stage
MLD Repo testing PCCR in the repo
Radiotherapy 3.0 - awaiting sign off from Wendy
Radiotherapy 4.0 - awaiting updates on dashboard, pending testing
PRMS - wally received requirements and needs to develop
User Acceptance Testing
Do not have a concept of systems
Morning Tea
Ate chia pudding and fruit skewer
Lisa
Breast Reconstruction project
Get data
link it to other dataset to see if risk or not ?
If there is a risk go statewide -> cancer notification
Data points might be from a form somewhere
Encodscopy
Who has had a colonoscopy
project in the process of getting hands on the data (1 go to each of LHD, 2 access via data lake)
could add the MLD
Data lake usage, how can we get access to it
identify patients eligible and send them a survey
Penny
Uncoded pipeline ( currently a lite pipeline )
QA processes
Pipeline to quality check batch files in particular
Does not need NSWCR ruleset to achieve
idea of a full pipeline (not just MLD can have QA purposes etc)
Interstate Notifications Pipeline
4-5 various formats (e.g QLD has HL7 formats)
PIPELINE - All need to be standardised into the one format to pipeline to put it into NSWCR
Currently not getting any notifications from QLD
QLD ready to receive just in HL7 format
possibly SA if it is electronic
Everystate has cancer registry, if they receive something with NSW address will send it to us (QLD and VIC usually receive NSW addresses).
SABR (Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy) pipeline
Currently parked, no indication for a pipeline
Participants = 1 centre (liverpool)
SABR flag in existing data sets? (rules that creates a flag)
small sample size
not data set ext for erod, clinicians what to see long term effects on patients
AYA (adolescents and young adults) pipeline
diagnosed and treated in NSW / ACT
What is occuring in the last 6 month not last 3 years
sequencing codes (Richard)
Internal linkage
Simone Young (under Haley) working on AYA - more about activity than data
CNP (cancer notification ) Pipeline
Do not receive any QA of notifications created with error rules
Powerbi quality error check - Sedricx has started a power bi dash and reporting view from the NSWCR to refine the reporting to CNPS notifications.
help to identify bulk of the outliers -> reporting quality
pipeline (cleaning and transforming) may not be needed for this
NSW & ACT Hereditary Cancer Registry
we have an instance of trackgene database (https://www.trakgene.com/)
from 1990s
Lunch
Sandwiches
Issues
Data types (Veronica)
import dates as varchar
transform as proper date format
low priority
Dates may be tricky when timezones are factored in
Ewan (replace vs append)
Agreed to replace for base data and append for analytics data
Versioning (Phillip)
Go with semantic versioning
Planning Session
Assigned items to months of the year
Seminars, Abstracts and posters -> would do an abstract on Machine Learning or data standardisation
Conferences -> Most of them sound good, would attend Melbourne analytics conference in March, should attend ones that address data quality and standardisation as well as analytics with health data to gauge what is going on in the data space, if we are up to date or even if we are the ones that are cutting edge.
