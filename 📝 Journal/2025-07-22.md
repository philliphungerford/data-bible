	  Hi Phil,
	  See below from George! DataForUse is a good start, prioritising APDC, NSWCR if possible.
	  Thanks! I’m on leave tomorrow
	  Kind regards,

	  Subject: MLD data for DB server
	  
	  Hi Peter,
	  As you know, here is our MLD base folder:
	  S:\Source Data\Master Linked Data\2020-45-06-CR2022\
	  Under the base folder, three data folders contain the processed data:
	  DataForUse                            - general data (NSWCR, APDC, etc.)
	  DataForScreening                   - screening data (breast, bowel and cervical)
	  DataForACT                           - ACT data (not received yet)
	   
	  The first two folders are ready.
	  Under each folder, there is a subfolder “Metadata” where locates meta files, one file for each dataset (table).   The attribute “Length” is not helpful and realistic in this batch of MLD, the issue was originated from the earlier providers before CheReL.
	  I guess we will load up only the zipped csv files.    I am not sure if they will fit to the DB structure.  Let me know if I can process further. 
	  Have a look first, we can discuss later if needed. 
	  Kind regards,
	  George
