Epath seems to be fixed, by using system2 instead of reticulate. Just now need to see if we can get XML from the same server then implement our python code to find the metastasis words and predict metastasis. 
Also compiled stuff for the MLD project need to build schemas by next Wednesday #todo. 
Email from Kirby re PRMS app crashing because of the PRMS BASE schema update, need to check this (tomorrow or friday) and let her know the status #todo.

- #email to [[anthony-di-leo]] and [[geoffrey-williams]] about [[rworkbench_load_testing]]

	  That sounds great, 
	  I am sure we could setup some example use cases for comparison as our goal is to have more people use workbench/POSIT servers.
	  For testing I think our use cases will most likely be:
	  Developing apps/pipelines
	  Running pipelines
	  Building ML models
	  Running/deployed apps/pipelines
	  I myself could be developing and tesing apps, whilst having an ML model train, and also have shiny apps on the POSIT server for clients to use of which some of those apps might use the ML python backends. 
	  In terms of what we could measure time it takes, CPU load and memory for (just spitballing here):
	  basic pipeline?
	  training a simple model? 
	  running multiple imputation if needed? 
	  multicore/session analysis? 
	  @Peter Moritz (Cancer Institute NSW) you might have some better ideas on this. 
	  FYI - did manage to get my app running on the dev server. Turns out the package reticulate in R that was calling python was not allocating memory/resources properly and trying to use more memory than what was available in R (errors like *** caught segfault *** address 0x158, cause 'memory not mapped'). Instead I switched to using a function 'system2' in R which runs the Python script in a separate subprocess, isolating it from the R environment and avoiding memory issues and seems to be working fine.
