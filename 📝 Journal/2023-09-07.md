Hello, so you managed to successfully migrate the snapshot validation to Ewans code. You updated the graph stuff. You were trying to optimise the code but idk if you really need to. You could just do a PR for it but it is up to you. You also need to finish up the grants stuff it looks pretty straight forward to me just go through the email from Leighna on Monday and add the variables and rename them. You had a meeting this morning around the PRMS stuff it sounds like a fun project, need to scope that though. Other than that all good!
