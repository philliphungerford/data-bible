	  Good morning Phillip,
	   
	  This is in reply to your chat msg, I think email is more suitable at this point.
	   
	  I’ve created the databases but you won’t have any access yet, until we’ve worked out the right AD group to use.
	   
	  Here’s a short description of how access to SQL servers and databases works at CI. You probably know most of it already, but bear with me.
	   
	  To connect to a SQL Instance, you must have a logon on the Instance. This can be by way of either
	  (a) a SQL login (SQL username, password),
	  these are for applications or 
	  (b) using Windows integrated security – i.e. whoever or whatever is trying to connect must exist in Active Directory.
	   
	  We don’t create logins for individuals (if we did, it’d be the person’s Stafflink number), rather we put people into AD groups set up for the purpose,
	  and the groups are then given logins on the server(s) that the group is intended for.
	   
	  A login only lets you make a connection, it doesn’t automatically give any database access. For that you need to grant the login permissions (read, write etc)
	  on each database it needs use.
	   
	  (Technical note, before someone shoots me down for the above: no that’s not actually how it works, but it’s a simple and quite adequate picture that everyone can easily
	  understand and use.)
	   
	  Re access to the new database, it’s much better to add people into an existing group if possible, rather than set up a new one. You mentioned ‘MLD’ but I can’t see it
	  in any group name; here’s a complete list of Windows logins on DW_DEV:
	   
	  (NSWHEALTH is the domain, right of the \  is the AD group.)

	  NSWHEALTH\L-CINS-SQL-ScreeningDataWarehouse-Tobacco-Non-Prod-Modify
	  NSWHEALTH\L-CINS-SQL-ScreeningDataWarehouse-Tobacco-Non-Prod-ReadOnly
	   
	  The decision as to which group(s) might be suitable for the new database is not one the DBAs can make.
	  We can find out who’s in each one and what access it has, but this should already be known to the manager
	  who approved the access, authority for that approval having been delegated ultimately from the CI Data Custodian.
	  (I think that’s how it works.)
	   
	  Something we’re currently looking at in IT is a review of all login groups with a view to some rationalisation, we
	  suspect that many have been created ad hoc over time and that there’s been little thought of coordinating between
	  teams, if and where applicable. That in turn depends on the degree of access granularity needed.
	   
	  But right now, please let me know if I can help you or anyone with a suitable group for EPI_MASTER_LINKED_DATASET.
	   
	  Regards,
	  Russell Cameron

	- ok its 7pm and i know you would finish early, but you have tidied everything nicely. all you need to do tomorrow is optimise your 'metastasis context' getting function such that it forgets about items before the sentence if they are a new line break as well, that should shorten the metastasis text lines.
	- Then rerun the algorithm and wait to see results
- nurosym review
	- hey everyone just wanted to give a review of the nurosym device, after using it for a year
	- I first heard about the nurosym from a youtube video talking about vagus nerve stimulation
	- and can help your body relax by activating the parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest)
	- And that resonated with me because I always felt like I was in rush or in a state of fight or flight
	- does it work?
	- yes absolutely
	- So i have been using it every single day for over a year now
	- and i cant live without it, its one of my favourite pieces of tech
	- I use it every night before bed and its help me fall asleep very quickly, because it calms me down very quickly in minutes for me
	- and i noticed when i don't use it, it is a bit harder to fall asleep
	- i also use it when i start work and i find it helps me get in the zone
	- tip is to use electrode gel and it really helps
