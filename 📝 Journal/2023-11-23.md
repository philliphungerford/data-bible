hey you are so close to finishing CT.
You have put all of the master stuff together you just need to upload it to the DB this is in the file CreateHistoricalIssues.R)
You also need to just adjust the fExecuteQualityAssessment.R file so that it overwrites the table with NEW issues detected whilst also checking if they exist in the historical table.
