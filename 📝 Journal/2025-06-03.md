Managed to get the app running by NOT using reticulate. It actually calls the python code from a script using the system2 package. The only caveat is that you have to hardcode what python you wish to use like below. This does, however, split the code into two but I think it should work fine now. 
Need to test this on the server 
Create pipeline with predictions
Validate against others 
Test that it actually is using only one thread each
