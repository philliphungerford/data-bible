Summary
You updated the code for snowflake by refactoring the grants base pipeline. You saved the files in GMS_Snowflake_part 1 and 2 in the grants base data sharepoint folder.
You need to copy that code over into the base data

You then should be able to just copy over the entire ETL into snowflake and run that and it should work easily thanks!
