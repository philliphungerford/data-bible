See [[ðŸ“Š Snapshot Validation Tab Multiple Tables Update]]. Just need to finish off the last plot. Then add option for patients over time table. Ok it is 155am on the 16th now (Friday night) but you fixed the issue and just need to put back in the unique patients table.
Select Timestamp, IDCOL, for all data. Then summarise the data by count and group by the timestamp. and post that.
Finish on Monday! And then move onto Grants for the rest of the week :)
