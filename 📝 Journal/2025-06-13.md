		  Hi all,
		  
		   
		  
		  As part of last night’s patching we’ve now rolled out the Workbench Administrative Dashboard to all environments.
		  
		  It should allow us to monitor the server usage in real-time.
		  
		   
		  
		  I’ve only provisioned access for the testuser account as an admin so far, I played a little with superuser which allows you to kill or assume control of active sessions, might be needed if anyone gets out of control. Superuser also lets you impersonate other users which could be problematic which is why I reverted testuser to just admin.
		  
		   
		  
		  Here are the relevant URLs to get to the admin dashboard per environment, it just looks like the normal Workbench login page.

		  Prod - https://rsworkbench.nswhealth.net/admin

		  Thanks a lot Russell that clears a lot up for me, appreciate the explanation and investigation. 
		  We do have an AD group that have access to a shared drive with the people we wish to share this DB with. The group is:
		  L-CINS-MassStorage_SourceDataMasterLinkedData
		  However, I do not see it in your list. Is it easy to add that group to the data servers and grant that group access? 
		  I believe I should be in that group as well but I am not sure
		  Thanks!
