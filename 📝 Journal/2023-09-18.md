hey there :) So you have managed to finish the snapshot validation dash, you just need to make sure your code is tidy and do a pull request. You are still waiting for Jamie to give you the publications stuff for the publications app You are still waiting for Leighna to approve your approach for Grants. What you can do is just import the variable you think you need and just run with it anyway, do everything else you need to do and then give it to Leighna like that so you are not blocked for much longer. The audit is on hold whilst you do the other stuff.
