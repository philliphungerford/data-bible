- Was having major issues with my laptop via the bitlocker error, had to go into the office to get it fixed.

	- The pipeline for metastasis is almost finished but i am having troubles testing it. This is because:
	  1. the data is stored on the NSWCR server that workbench cannot access
	  2. I can access it via my windows machine and therefore pull the data 
	  3. The issue with the windows machine is that it does not have the proper conda envs and I am having issues installing and setting that up. 
	  4. So if i cant get that to work, I might have to pull the data from my windows machine and write it to a db in the server than linux CAN handle 
	  5. Use linux machine to use the AI to parse the data and update the table. 
	  Currently, I have my code on my windows machine Documents/_windows_repos/epath etc so thats where the current stuff is stored! So when you start tomorrow, open RStudio and open this, then save the data to a db, then run the AI interpreter from ubuntu and save it back. 
	  I could also just ask to get ci_data_assets to get access to the NSWCR epath database and table and that should work out.

	  Hi guys,
	  
	  May also be worth noting if any of your processes have any heavy impact on disk or network.
	  I’d assume pulling large datasets from the DBs and then manipulating them locally is what most of the apps do.
	  
	  The current servers have disk bandwidth of up to 4750Mbps with limited IOPS and network bandwidth up to 10Gbps.
	  The new instance types we’re looking at increases both of these up to 10Gbps and 12.5 Gbps respectively.
	  
	  We’re also suggesting use of EFS storage for the home drives so the increased network bandwidth will help there.

	  Hey Peter
	  On our side you can kick off at anytime really, maybe pop a note in the teams channel so others are aware, if the server goes out to lunch/fails to come back; reach out to Geoff and Myself and we’ll escalate for a reboot.
	  
	  The server specs are currently 4vCPU/8GB
	  
	  Once you have your baselines we’ll add those config changes and you can test again
