Data Analytics Meeting
Additional Radio extract might need more indicators as well as upcoming pathways analyses
Wendys team DART, can reupdate
main variables used for OROD (Primary diagnoses -> Type ~ 5 main variables)
Data quality issues
Received data -> raw data (interp)
Extracting intent from other variables
A lot of curating of data (intent vs dose variables)
Wish list items
Data journey -> poor data -> engineering -> analytics teams (needs fixing from the source)
Mapped site name not course name etc
Give them as much raw data as possible via MLD (tidy for generic charts and original raw data if they have questions)
==Variable name mapping to ATD for the team
ethics approval process
ATD has variables approved that we may not have
Should have a list of all variables in ATD and actual variables in PCCR
Course_ID flag
MLD files stored on S drive
To do:
Variable mapping
Raw vs derived site names in extract
