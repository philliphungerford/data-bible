	- ```
	  Hi Phillip / Peter,
	  I've created accounts for each of you to perform testing in the Workbench Test environment.
	  At Phil's request, I also gave you admin access so you can view the stats in real-time.
	   
	  Workbench URL: https://rsconnect-test.nswhealth.net:8787
	  Admin URL: https://rsconnect-test.nswhealth.net:8787/admin
	   
	  Credentials have been provided in Teams. If the randomly generated ones are a hassle, reach out and we can reset them to something memorable.
	  The accounts will expire in a year on 25/06/2026.
	  ```
