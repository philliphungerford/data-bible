Notes
[[ðŸ‘¤ Jacquelyn Abbott]] gave access to GMS
Hi PhillipFollowing up from our meeting just now, I have created a user account for you in the GMS UAT system.Sign in with your email as the user name, and password is GMSisfun1.!The home screen is very empty compared to what I had â€“ this is the back end, and what we see as system administrators.Iâ€™ve set up an Application tile and Project tile if you need to access either quickly.If you go to the Red Button in the top left hand corner and select Grants Management System, that will take you to what the applicant sees.Youâ€™ll see there are numerous grant rounds available â€“ out of these, SRI owns the Career Development Fellowship, Translational Program Grant, and Travel Grant applications.You can create new applications if you need to run through what is on the forms.Let me know if you require any further info.Kind Regards,Jacqui
