Sprint Catch-Up
1200 - Clinical Trials App
Historical (rerunning old code - quality pipeline NOT BASE PIPELINE)
Stuff that is submitted is correct (rules setup to make sure all the correct data is correct)
Master csv files stashed in teams folder
List of every issue they have ever had (cannot revise, rule needs modification, fixed)
active files are stored in a teams folder -> nikky and team update
contains live issues and the
Is linked with base data pipeline
Comes from the CT portal
Code reads the files in and generates new files
major flaw was that there is no way to generate single site files because she edited them
The whole thing crashes if there is a filename change
What nikky needs
an app that shows her all of the unresolved issues that she can mark the status
that updates the database in the backend as she does it
lock down the rules to make clear what the rules are and whether they are active or inactive (with the ability to update the rules)
Need the base pipeline and make sure the error rules are working
Build app from the base pipeline in order to do the quality stuff
To do
Figure out what is going - a replica of the radiotherapy quality dashboard, we get source files, run error rules and spit out a report
Do issues and rule checking (needs a level of interacting, turning rules on or off and filter within that)
Export that nikky can look at OR that can be split into site specific files that can be emailed off
Replicate rules that they have got
We are in charge of base pipeline and that runs periodically
Need to mock up dashboard for nikky to see if that is what she would like
Kathryn ran the base pipeline and then Ewan the quality pipeline
Figure out what the base data does
How we can split up errors and how they are logged in the base?
Base runs base with errors but errors picked up in the quality dash
ACTIONS
get access to base data pipeline
josh will mock up dashboard
