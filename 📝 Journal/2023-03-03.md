0930 - Grants Dashboard
Questions
What is the database? Where is the information coming from?
Grants management sysmte JMS run by F1 solutions 3rd party vendor
User goes to the website to submit applications
We have created a SQL database that pulls the data from the website into database
Leighna has access to SQL
We can access it via the SQL database
ACTION -> LEIGHNA to find name of server and database and get access to it
Need to get a grants base update to clean primary organisation
primary (might be administaring) vs contact organisation (might be facilitating)
Primary - only a few (UNSW, USYD, WSU??)
Contact - where they sit (more detailed)
ACTION -> LEIGHNA will find out terms
Start date might be project start date
Application -> round year variable;[ApplicationRoundName] (connect application to project) ApplicationReference might have year information too.
Would want it for both application and grants
Most Projects are a subset of Applications, however if a project does not have an application it may be a ‘special’ project, id will have type they are (coffunder, special, premiers award)
Project start date will appear in daily extracts
Updated every 430am
CSI & S&P data is here and come under ‘community’
Clinical vs Category groupings are the same (They have been using category groupings)
Project vs CSO category
ProjectCategoryName -> Not all of the categories are ‘ours’
ICRP cancer type as our cancer
Some people use clinical groupings to measure cancer type
SRI have specific category names
Community do not use ICRP cancer type
Check out mappings
3 themes they want moving forward (using tags)
e.g. want to know if project works with paedeiatrics
Male / female
Davids script gets it from two locations
Account
It is asked in the application process (in the account you can specify your gender)
Application
Asks for gender
If one does not have gender then it grabs from the other.
Not available for everyone, only started collecting recently.
Not available here but they have been collecting it in newer pipe
Tumour / cancer type
Bone, lung, etc
ProjectCategoryName has ICRP name
If 50% or above that is the main focus cancer type
If someone has 3 cancer types then they wont have any (all < 50%).
Match ICRP to ICD10?
We know that Breast cancer is X
We also know that
Better approach?
How can we label these?
Percentage is entered into the CMS
Q how much have we invested in bone cancer (we have 2 with a main focus)
amount shows % cancer x funding (e.g. 5% bone cancer x total = total bone cancer funding)
Don’t worry about clinical trials
Dashboard mockup walkthrough
p3 - additional
cancer plan focus populations (LGBTQI+, Rural regional etc) - check cancer plan for these
copy of P4 possible to split by scheme
portfolio filter for overview (translational vs career development)
all and by portfolio
copy of p7 - project names etc what grants are prostate cancer grants?
Want to know who to contact
Where they are located (admin institution)
Requests are usually by topic (how many people for certain type of cancer)
CANDLE creates community of practice to be able to share it with external researchers
Data controllers control who gets access to data via SURE
Expedited ethics (every 6 weeks)
AD HOC PROJECT - TCRC - 85mill program - 2021
Program has finished (forever)
Wasnted counts and information
number of members, publications
Just want high level stuff
Bronson put it into one file and it died
ACTIONS
MARIA
To send slides to Leigna
LEIGHNA
Find name of server and database and get access to it
Will share with team and send notes
Need to finalise information about the filters that will be useful
Schemes
Cancers
Find out terms for primary and contact organisations
PHILLIP ## 2023-03-02, Thursday
Check SARA ticket for drive access next week might be waiting for MARIA (who will be back next week)
Create SARA ticket to get access to server and DB from above 1300 - Sprint catchup
1100 - MLD/CANDLE LINKAGE
MLD
Questions
Time frames for extracts and linkages
When we should start doing the identifier process?
Timing with POOJA (content ready by early May latest)
No MLK update in APRIL
We cannot send identifiers until MLK is updated first
Trying to get them to do it sooner
Get data back = get PPNs
Analysts start in late may
First reports in August
ACTION -> Michelle to send list of protocols for items required from PRMS for new extracts
Amendments?
Submitted and under review.
Expanding cohort for people screened or participated and invited for screening
Mental health ambulatory data
Separating PRMS from OROD
Addition of PRMs
The main difference between MLD and CANDLE?
Is it just the cervical cancer dataset?
CANDLE
Questions
What is the difference?
Excluding upcoming amendment (amendments will make CANDLE closer to MLD with the goal of having CANDLE as a subset of MLD - requiring only one linkage process)
Candle has 2 cohorts
people with cancer (same as MLD)
women screened (not in MLD)
Goal two separate governance for MLD and CANDLE
Ideally can get candle from MLD in the future
hopefully add men to screening
Frequency is yearly
Could have two CANDLE linkages a year (year month)
Is it ok to use the same codebase
This time Candle used MLD datasets to do CANDLE linkage
They used MLD files, this means PPNS are record level and not person level, need to consider that for CANDLE content data.
? PPNS different for CANDLE ?
PPNS are different for CANDLE vs MLD
Eventually all PPNS will be from one MLD linkage
Will be able to filter CANDLE from MLD in the future
Cohorts should have been 1,2 or both.
Maybe need two columns (cohort (1/2) and both (true/false))
For people that want to explore the data
Feedback loop for researchers
Researchers meetings
Feedback on data quality statements
Communications being figured out
Understanding timing
Create form to keep track
Notes
Cohorts
One ~ 1.5 mill
A primary cohort of people diagnosed with or treated for cancer in NSW from the NSW Cancer Registry, and a subset of the NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection (APDC) with a malignant condition in the diagnosis code.
Two ~ 3mill
All women in NSW who participated in either breast or cervical cancer screening, all women who were diagnosed with or treated for cancer in NSW from the NSW Cancer Registry, and all women in a subset of the NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection (APDC) with a malignant condition in the diagnosis code.
Datasets
Radio (MLD)
PCCR (MLD)
NSWCR (Uncoded MLD)
Screening Registry?
ED
Births deaths marriages
NSW Pap test
Breast Screen
