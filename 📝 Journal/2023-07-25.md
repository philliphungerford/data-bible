1100 - PCCR data supply for the MLD
Prostate cancer pathway report
Map out the treatment pathway from the PCCR data
Adjuvent radio, salvage
Data structure
Granularity
Case vs episode or both
What variables?
Timing of each treatment (start and end?)
PSA test at each time point
Is last years format enough?
Or what do you want?
get cancer information to put them in a risk group (case level information)
pathway datasets
can each treatment or diagnosis be assigned for baseline or followup
treatment = align treatment to stages (12m)
CURRENTLY
Give last years format
flag baseline or followup
see what we would like to keep
try and make any amendments
From external extract
Two datasets
case
survey
treatment (start date, end date, type of surgery, ADTType, ADTAgent)
MLD Uncoded - fixed procedure codes and missing start and end episode dates. tidied up code a lot which now makes a lot more sense
Send off to Amy when you can!
