- #teams [[russell-cameron]] showed me the [[database-permissions]] table and gave access to ci_data_assets for the [[epath_lung_monitor/v151]] project. Will need to create a new SQL user though for the epi team which will probably be 'ci_epi_bio'.
- spoke to [[wally-shi]] re PRMS localised app
	- SurveyResponseAnswer has been split into 3 tables
		- SurveyResponse (one response is like one survey)
		- SurveyResponseAnswer (links to the suvery response)

- Master Patient Table Meeting

	- We need to compile all possible things to test
		- MCMC - peter has code for
		- PIPELINE - I can use my AI algorithm
			- Single core which is done
			- DONE create multicore version
	- Test MAX RAM  + CORE usage
		- Start with max
