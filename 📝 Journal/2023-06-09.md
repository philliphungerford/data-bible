Notes
howdy homeboy, so today you were going through the grants stuff, applications and applications with categories are very different sizes so lets just create one with the categories (factApplications.)
You created a document for what the GMS is and designed a flowchart with tables for draw.io. so now you have the original flow and your star schema design which may need some tweaking. Looks like most things are already in v1.0 and you just need to rearrange some things which is a good indication. The dashboard should be an easy 1 or 2 days with powerbi just make sure the variables are all there in the spec sheet. Thanks that should be it, also josh will send you the MLD files next week and we push to prod next week!
