	- Lost a bit of days worth of notes but no big deal. Have put everything basically into my WSL Ubuntu image, under ubuntu_files and running everything out of vscode which seems to be working very quickly and efficiently.
	- Looks like we can use Fine-tune Bio_ClinicalBERT on a Labeled Dataset
	  If you have clinical notes with known CaseType or metastasis status, you can fine-tune Bio_ClinicalBERT for text classification. Which we actually do have!
	  Can I use the labelled stuff from 2022 that Abrevio already labelled and we train this model on the outputs of that.

	  Hi Phil, So Nicole from governance said you’ve already been added to the MLD protocol! If you can’t access the MLD folder (S:\Source Data\Master Linked Data), then please complete this SARA form: [https://sara.health.nsw.gov.au/customerportal?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9fff8b14dbf09010b9d0cef405961998&searchTerm=share%20drive](https://sara.health.nsw.gov.au/customerportal?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9fff8b14dbf09010b9d0cef405961998&searchTerm=share%20drive "https://sara.health.nsw.gov.au/customerportal?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9fff8b14dbf09010b9d0cef405961998&searchTerm=share%20drive").The path to put in the form is: [\\nswhealth.net\ci\MassStorage\SASData\Source](https://outlook.office.com/local/path/file://nswhealth.net/ci/MassStorage/SASData/Source "file://nswhealth.net/ci/MassStorage/SASData/Source") Data\Master Linked Data. Put the data custodian down as Lisa McCallum (she is aware that the request will be coming).Let me know if there are any issues! I’ll let Richard know on Monday as he’ll need to approve. He knows about the project but not that you are already on the MLD – I asked! I don’t know who added you to MLD but no complaints here!I’ll set up a meeting next week for us to discuss the project further and discuss some requirements.Kind regards,
