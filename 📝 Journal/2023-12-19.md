Niki
Issues that she is facing:
STATES - We need to know what CTU’s have non-NSW patients (e.g. Murrumbigi).
CAPPING - Some trials are capped at 100. Capped trials do not do back pays. (she has a list of these in a spreadsheets). In the portal there is a column called cumulative enrolled.
Get cumulative enrolled at the beginning for each CTU
Adding cumulative enrolled can be version 1 and flag if over 100
calculating the issue of counting identifying
Version 2 - for identifying what
App to flag if patient has been paid in the last quarter (currently Niki checks the adjustments). - RARE occurence
LHD is paid -> they pay the CTU -> Patients paid
There was an issue where RNS rad onc moved patients to med onc they were flagged that they should be paid.
Each CTU each trial Patients are only paid per enrollment (once).
Script picks up adjustments
Is adding a patient that they may have missed
Removed a patient that was not eligible until the next quarter
Would be good to know what patient ids were removed or added
Payments issue
Patients that are paid are not captured so we assume based on the report.
16 LHD and 8 Private groups
Be careful with back payments
Then she has to email them out.
File them in RMS

Spreadsheet - list of CTU List all LHD and trial units. Data comes from CTU level, pay at LHD level. Filter by LHD If green they have signed off (this is seen in the portal). Missing is ok because it would be a test unit. Everyone submits on a date (e.g. 15th Friday December). They put it in the port and we verify it to get ‘Date Verified’ Today Do private sites first  Go into portal > reconciliation > approve and finalise Run the r script Copy and paste the outputs to another directory Identify new enrolments Highlight the private entities (lhdCTUTrial and LHDforfinance) Prepare and Give payment summaries Copy and paste items from spreadsheet to payment summary sheet Go through adjustments to see if there are any adjustments (also check adjustment comments) ignore adjustments. Need to consider CAPS on entities as they have been capped (maybe create table for capped LHD) Private are easy but LHD are tedious to make reports for Notes - NBP (no back pay) Make updates from post R script.
