1000 - Clinical Trials (CTMS)
Might need a new system
New DB system
Key entities for clinical trials
System should be agile
Is a base data set
Analytics dataset was worked on but not documented or kept so may need a new one
Nikki has finalised standardising systems
Shannon said hown how payments work
Run workshops to validate what we have got
Need to find out what the requirements are
linkage with CTMS in terms of importing (That they are building - it is live and they can use it, reports are available not for BI).
Build a portable so that people can upload their data/report
Maybe link to CTMS and then can prefill for researchers
Look into portal to see what already exists
The key things we need are
entities
create schema based on use cases
David Currow asking for extract (data from the last year)
DJANGO app
Create analytics dataset to clean up semantics of base data
