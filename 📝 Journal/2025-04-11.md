	- Design some schema layouts
	  (1) we save as one large table where each row is sourceID like in the code already generated.
	  (2) star schema with a table view for analysts (scalable to other datasets…)
	  source (XML) → staging(XML) → warehouse (star schema)
	  Certainly! Here's the comparison in dot points:
	  Reduced Redundancy : Data is stored only once in dimension tables (e.g., patient details), saving storage and ensuring consistency.
	  Scalability : The schema can easily handle growing datasets and new data attributes without major changes.
	  Improved Performance : Optimized queries and joins due to normalized structure, leading to faster data retrieval and reporting.
	  Data Integrity : Controlled vocabularies and relationships between tables help maintain accurate and reliable data.
	  Easier Maintenance : Updating or adding new data is simpler, as changes are localized to dimension tables rather than affecting every row in a flat table.
	  Better Historical Tracking : Easier to track and manage historical changes (e.g., patient info or diagnosis updates) with Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD).
	  Efficient Aggregation : Supports more efficient aggregation queries, which is crucial for reporting and analysis.
	  Flat Table Drawbacks : Flat tables lead to data duplication, slower performance, and harder maintenance as data grows.
