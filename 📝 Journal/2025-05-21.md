- [[epath_lung_monitor/v151]]
	- Got the metastesis model working for zero shot and few shot (few shot takes a while to run).
	- [[richard-walton]] - Showed Richard the epath work, happy to continue.
- #meeting [[joshua-herden]] for [[+unprocessed_pipeline]]
	- Building the unprocessed pipeline for the data engineering team
	  Unprocessed is data that gets automatically ingested into the NSWCR BEFORE it gets coded by a coder. These include ABREVIO EPATH, EDWARD/HIE, and private CNP (via portal) sources. 
	  Strucure for NSWCR => SHEENA -> [[@Lisa]] (for setup and qa) + [[@Nitu]] (for putting data into the NSWCR)
	  Note about the [[epath_lung_monitor/v151]] project. The epath notifications that are unprocessed but flagged as 'lung' in the NCSWR Case Type can only be flagged as lung when their is an existing case for that person FROM A HOSPITAL. This means that it is not truly capturing streamed lung data as a person could get a path report for lung today but if they do not have any hospital data relating to it, then that would not be flagged as lung because there isnt a related case that has been coded already. This means that we might have to also scan the other reports using our AI model to see if they could be lung cancer or not. 
	  [[epath_lung_monitor/v151]] - see if we can use our AI to find other lung reports that have not been coded as lung based on the above
