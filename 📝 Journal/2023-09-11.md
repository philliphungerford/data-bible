Hey buddy, so you managed to get the snapshot validation dashboard up and running, you moved it to UAT, waiting for Josh to validate and we can do the pull request. For grants, you have figured most of it out just waiting on Leighna to validate the amount expended variable. You already imported the milestone table into python code so that is what you are up to line 162.
