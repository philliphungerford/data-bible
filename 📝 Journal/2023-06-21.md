Meetings
0830 - Starting checklist
1430 - [[Geo-coding Machine]]
Origin - Zara and Amir gave tables and asked for the addresses to be geo-coded
Martin’s team uses geocoding machine from cancer registry
Runs every Wednesday and Friday - can be scheduled for quicker
Geocoding machine is from IQ office from INTECH together
Machine Process (DB: Data_Pipelines_Geocoding)
New data is put into input table ending in ‘Table’
Looks up delta, if anything new then updates the geocoding machine
Updates are written to table ending in ‘Geocode’
New results are only once we re-query the table
Uses Fuzzy logic matching for addresses
D&E should look at adding other pipelines to it as well
D&E would always be using PROD version of Geo-coding database
Actions
Martins team pushing to prod on 26th, no changes so far
Update code on our side to write to PROD
Will consider one master address table with added column for data source (e.g. “Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy, PCCR etc”)
