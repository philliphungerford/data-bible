Hey!
You are waiting for Leighna for grants You finished the snapshot validation stuff and created a pull request that you can get the guys to do next week You did Veronicas PR You did the cyber security module and fraud modules for myhealthlearning Jamie finally gave you the publications sheet. You converted it to be used into the app and it works! You also updated the add and edit buttons and added a cool popup for deleting. You just need to finish the backend table setup, that is, have the data save locally when something is added. You then need to go through the publications and update their abtracts and values etc.
