Today try and do a deep dive into…
1 Small language models NLP vs Language models R package {spacyr} https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spacyr/vignettes/using\_spacyr.html (this will need Python) Anyone used LLMs to read pathology forms or other semi-structured, free text medical data. One of our aims is to extract information from this kind of data (above) we should use both LMs and NLP in a 2-horse race.

2 See if anyone has written about conforming an address to GNAF (AS 4819:2011) standard? Are there any open source efforts around? How does this differ from geo-coding? https://github.com/simongis/gnaf-for-arcgis Do we try to map address to formatted address? If input is free text to GNAF mapping… Alternatively we train a model on the GNAF, use the formatted address to predict the lat and long. Then we use ‘formatted addresses’ as input and see if it predicts the long and lat correctly.
preprocess
named entity recognition (NER) to identify and categorize address components such as street names, numbers, and locality.
Implement fuzzy matching algorithms (e.g., Levenshtein distance) to handle spelling variations and typos.
3 CuSum charts (in general and in R) ### What is CUSUM?
CUSUM stands for Cumulative Sum Control Chart. It is a statistical tool used to monitor a process over time by keeping track of the cumulative sum of deviations from a target or expected value. Here’s how to understand it step-by-step: ### 1. Basic Idea of Cumulative Sum Imagine you are keeping track of how many cookies you bake every day, and you want to know if you are meeting your goal of baking 10 cookies each day. Now, if you keep a running total (cumulative sum) of these deviations: This means that over these two days, you are back to your target after baking more cookies one day and fewer the next. ### 2. What CUSUM Shows The CUSUM helps you see whether you are consistently meeting your target over time: ### 3. Visualization Imagine you draw a graph with time on the x-axis (like days) and the CUSUM value on the y-axis. ### 4. Real-World Example: Healthcare Let’s relate this to a healthcare scenario, such as monitoring patient recovery times: ### Example Data

CUSUM is about tracking the cumulative deviations from a target over time.
It gives you a way to see if you are consistently meeting, exceeding, or falling short of your goals.
In practical applications, like healthcare, it helps monitor performance (like recovery times or adverse events) to ensure quality care.
The CUSUM values show how far you are from the target recovery time over the days.
A CUSUM of ( +2 ) means you have exceeded the target by 2 days cumulatively, while a ( 0 ) means you are back to the target after some fluctuations.
Suppose the target recovery time for patients is 10 days.
Each point on the graph represents your cumulative sum after each day.
If the graph goes up, it indicates that you are consistently exceeding your target.
If it goes down, you’re consistently underperforming compared to your target.
If your cumulative sum is positive, it means you are generally doing better than your target.
If your cumulative sum is negative, it means you are generally falling short of your target.
If the cumulative sum is steady or near zero, it indicates you are around your target.
Cumulative Sum after Day 1: ( 2 )
Cumulative Sum after Day 2: ( 2 + (-2) = 0 )
Day 1: You bake 12 cookies.
Deviation from target: ( 12 - 10 = 2 ) (positive deviation)
Day 2: You bake 8 cookies.
Deviation from target: ( 8 - 10 = -2 ) (negative deviation)
4 Measuring blurring in an image (methods/open source tools) https://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/proceedings/psb21/vodrahalli.pdf blurry images typically exhibit a higher presence of low-frequency components, which can be quantitatively assessed through techniques like the Fourier Transform or analyzing image gradients
