		- node information - number, which node etc
		- give richard API code to use / test
		- gave template for manuscript
			- find the true gaps
				- what we know
				- what do we need to know
			- optimising of algorithms
			- comparing to other methods
	- scc vs bcc - 8k in the rejects folder
		- check for that folder
	- scc + epath lung + variable pretty much all the same sort of thing
	- can we zip envs for recreating
- #meeting with [[peter-moritz]]

		- pick a date for testing
		- use multiple 'sessions' per person
		- need to test POSIT server as well

	- [[mld_migration_project]]
		- george still finishing cleaning
- [[prms_localised_report]]
	- had a look at the prms situation and besides the tables being different, the variables may have also changed, without the old data this is looking like an annoying project as i will have to create a bridge that bridges everything and find the links between the variables etc. might take me a day to complete
