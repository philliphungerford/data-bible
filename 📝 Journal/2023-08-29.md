So you got an email from sure saying that some variables did not pass ethics. You began checking the variables against the ATD but the main ones like OROD, OSTOD and Uncoded all look fine. My suspician may be PCCR and PRMS. I emailed Jessica back at SURE to see if she could let us know which datasets were having the issues but I still need to finish updating to code to make sure that the right variables are in all of the datasets.
